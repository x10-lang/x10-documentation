\label{XtenPlaces}
\index{place}

An \Xten{} place is a repository for data and activities, corresponding
loosely to a process or a processor. Places induce a concept of ``local''. The
activities running in a place may access data items located at that place with
the efficiency of on-chip access. Accesses to remote places may take orders of
magnitude longer. X10's system of places is designed to make this obvious.
Programmers are aware of the places of their data, and know when they are
incurring communication costs, but the actual operation to do so is easy. It's
not hard to use non-local data; it's simply hard to to do so accidentally.

The set of places available to a computation is determined at the time that
the program is started, and remains fixed through the run of the program. See
the {\tt README} documentation on how to set command line and configuration
options to set the number of places.

Places are first-class values in X10, as instances 
\xcd"x10.lang.Place".   \xcd`Place` provides a number of useful ways to
query places, such as \xcd`Place.places()`, which returns a
\xcd`PlaceGroup` of the places available to the current run of the program.

Objects and structs are created in a single place -- the
place that the constructor call was running in. They cannot change places.
They can be {\em copied} to other places, and the special library struct
\Xcd{GlobalRef} allows values at one place to point to values at another.  

\section{The Structure of Places}
\index{place!FIRST\_PLACE}
\index{FIRST\_PLACE}

Places are numbered starting at 0; the number is stored
in the field \xcd`pl.id`.  The method \xcd`Place.numPlaces()` returns the number of
Places in the current execution of the program. 
The program starts by executing a \xcd`main` method at
%~~exp~~`~~`~~ ~~ ^^^ Places20
\xcd`Place.FIRST_PLACE`, which is 
%~~exp~~`~~`~~ ~~ ^^^ Placesoik
\xcd`Place.places()(0)`; see
\Sref{initial-computation}. 

\section{{\tt here}}\index{here}\label{Here}

The variable \xcd"here" is always bound to the place at which the current
computation is running, in the same way that \xcd`this` is always bound to the
instance of the current class (for non-static code), or \xcd`self` is bound to
the instance of the type currently being constrained.  
\xcd`here` may denote different places in the same method body or even the
same expression, due to
place-shifting operations.


This is not unusual for automatic variables:  \Xcd{self} denotes 
two different values (one \xcd`List`, one \xcd`Long`) 
when one describes a non-null list of non-zero numbers as
\xcd`List[Long{self!=0}]{self!=null}`. In the following 
code, \xcd`here` has one value at 
\xcd`h0`, and a different one at \xcd`h1` (unless there is only one place).
%~~gen ^^^ Placesoijo
% package places.are.For.Graces;
% class Example {
% def example() {
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
val h0 = here;
val world = Place.places();
at (world.next(here)) {
  val h1 = here; 
  assert (h0 != h1);
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%} } 
% 
%~~neg
\noindent
(Similar examples show that \xcd`self` and \xcd`this` have the same behavior:
\xcd`self` can be shadowed by constrained types appearing inside of type
constraints, and \xcd`this` by inner classes.)



The following example looks through a list of references to \Xcd{Thing}s.  
It finds those references to things that are \Xcd{here}, and deals with them.

\section{ {\tt at}: Place Changing}\label{AtStatement}
\index{at}
\index{place!changing}

An activity may change place synchronously using the \xcd"at" statement or
\xcd"at" expression. Like any distributed operation, it is 
potentially expensive, as it requires, at a minimum, two messages
and the copying of all data used in the operation, and must be used with care
-- but it provides the basis for distributed programming in X10.

%##(AtStatement AtExp
\begin{bbgrammar}
%(FROM #(prod:AtStmt)#)
              AtStmt \: \xcd"at" \xcd"(" Exp \xcd")" Stmt & (\ref{prod:AtStmt}) \\
%(FROM #(prod:AtExp)#)
               AtExp \: \xcd"at" \xcd"(" Exp \xcd")" ClosureBody & (\ref{prod:AtExp}) \\
\end{bbgrammar}
%##)

The {\it PlaceExp} must be an expression of type \xcd`Place` or some
subtype. For programming convenience, if {\it PlaceExp} is of type
\xcd`GlobalRef[T]` then the \xcd'home' property of \xcd'GlobalRef' is
used as the value of {\it PlaceExp}.

An activity may also spawn an asynchronous remote child activity.  For
optimal performance, it is desirable for the spawning activity to
continue executing locally without waiting for the message creating
the remote child activity to arrive at the destination place. \Xten{}
supports this ``fire-and-forget'' style of remote activity creation by
special handling of the combination of \xcd'at (P) async S'.  In
particular, any exceptions raised during deserialization
(\Sref{sect:at-init-val}) at the remote place will be reported
asynchronously (as if they occured after the remote activity
\xcd`async S` was spawned).

%%AT-COPY%% The \xcd`at`-statment \xcd`at(p;F)S` first evaluates \xcd`p` to a place, then
%%AT-COPY%% copies information to that place as determined by \xcd`F`, and then executes
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`S` using the resulting copies.  The \xcd`at`-{\em expression}
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at(p;F)E` is similar, but it copies the result of the expression \xcd`E`
%%AT-COPY%% and returns the copy as its result.
%%AT-COPY%% 
%%AT-COPY%% The clause \xcd`F` in \xcd`at(p;F)S` is a list of zero or more {\em copy
%%AT-COPY%% specifiers}, explaining what values are to be copied to the place \xcd`p`, and
%%AT-COPY%% how they are to be referred to at \xcd`p`.  
%%AT-COPY%% 

%%AT-COPY%% \begin{ex}
%%AT-COPY%% The following example creates a rail \xcd`a` located \xcd`here`, and copies
%%AT-COPY%% it to another place, giving the copy the name \xcd`a2` there.  The copy is
%%AT-COPY%% modified and examined.  After the \xcd`at` finishes, the original is also
%%AT-COPY%% examined, and (since only the copy, not the original, was modified) is observed
%%AT-COPY%% to be unchanged.

%%AT-COPY%% 
%%AT-COPY%% A single copy specifier can be one of the following forms.   
%%AT-COPY%% Each copy specifier determines an {\em original-expression}, saying what value

%%AT-COPY%%       \xcd`x : T = E`, and 
%%AT-COPY%%       \xcd`val x <: T = E`, evaluate the expression \xcd`E` at the initial
%%AT-COPY%%       place, copy it to \xcd`p`, and bind \xcd`x` to the copy, as normal for a
%%AT-COPY%%       local \xcd`val` binding.  If a type is supplied, it is checked
%%AT-COPY%%       statically in the usual way.  
%%AT-COPY%%       The original-expression is \xcd`E`, and the target variable is \xcd`x`.
%%AT-COPY%% 
%%AT-COPY%% \begin{ex}
%%AT-COPY%% The following code copies a variable \xcd`a` located \xcd`here` to a variable
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`d` located \xcd`there`.  
%%AT-COPY%% Note that, while the copy \xcd`d` is available \xcd`there` inside of the \xcd`at`-block,
%%AT-COPY%% the original \xcd`a` is not.  (\xcd`a` could not be available in the block in

%%AT-COPY%% When this manual refers to a generic \xcd`at`-statement as \xcd`at(p;F)S`, it
%%AT-COPY%% should be understood as including the blanket \xcd`at` statement \xcd`at(p)S`
%%AT-COPY%% with this interpretation.
%%AT-COPY%% 

\subsection{Copying Values}
%%AT-COPY%% An activity executing statement \xcd"at (q;F) S" at a place \xcd`p`
%%AT-COPY%% evaluates \xcd`q` at \xcd`p` and then moves to \xcd`q` to execute
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`S`.  
%%AT-COPY%% The original-expressions of \xcd`F` are evaluated at \xcd`p`.
%%AT-COPY%% Their values are copied (\Sref{sect:at-init-val}) to \xcd`q`, and bound to 
%%AT-COPY%% names there, as specified by \xcd`F`.  
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`S` is evaluated in an environment containing the target variables of
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`F`, and \xcd`here` and {\em no} other variables.  (In particular, if this
%%AT-COPY%% statement appears in an instance method body and \xcd`this` is not copied,
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`this` is not accessible.  This fact is important: it allows the
%%AT-COPY%% programmer to control when \xcd`this` is copied, which may be expensive for
%%AT-COPY%% large containers.)

An activity executing \xcd`at(q)S` at a place \xcd`p` evaluates \xcd`q` at
place \xcd`p`, which should be a \xcd`Place`.  It then moves to place \xcd`q`
to execute \xcd`S`.  The values variables that \xcd`S` refers to are copied
(\Sref{sect:at-init-val}) to \xcd`q`, and bound to the variables of the same
name.   If the \xcd`at` is inside of an instance method and \xcd`S` uses
\xcd`this`, \xcd`this` is copied as well.  Note that a field reference
\xcd`this.fld` or a method call \xcd`this.meth()` will cause \xcd`this` to be
copied --- as will their abbreviated forms \xcd`fld` and \xcd`meth()`, despite
the lack of a visible \xcd`this`.  


Note that the value obtained by evaluating \xcd`q`
is not necessarily distinct from \xcd`p` (\eg, \xcd`q` may be
\xcd`here`). 
This does not alter the behavior of \xcd`at`.  
%%AT-COPY%%  \xcd`at(here;F)S` will copy all the values specified by \xcd`F`, 
%%AT-COPY%% even though there is no actual change of place, and even though the original
%%AT-COPY%% values already exist there.
\xcd`at(here)S` will copy all the values mentioned in \xcd`S`, even though
there is no actual change of place, and even though the original values
already exist there. 

On normal termination of \xcd`S` control returns to \xcd`p` and
execution is continued with the statement following 
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at (q;F) S`. 
\xcd`at (q) S`. 
If
\xcd`S` terminates abruptly with exception \xcd`E`, \xcd`E` is
serialized into a buffer, the buffer is communicated to \xcd`p` where
it is deserialized into an exception \xcd`E1` and \xcd`at (p) S`
throws \xcd`E1`.

Since 
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at(p;F) S` 
\xcd`at(p) S` 
is a synchronous construct, usual control-flow
constructs such as \xcd`break`, \xcd`continue`, \xcd`return` and 
\xcd`throw` are permitted in \xcd`S`.  All concurrency related
constructs -- \xcd`async`, \xcd`finish`, \xcd`atomic`, \xcd`when` are
also permitted.

The \xcd`at`-expression 
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at(p;F)E` 
\xcd`at(p)E` 
is similar, except that, in the case of
normal termination of \xcd`E`, the value that \xcd`E` produces is serialized
into a buffer, transported to the starting place, and deserialized, and the
value of the \xcd`at`-expression is the result of deserialization.

\subsection{How {\tt at} Copies Values}
\label{sect:at-init-val}

%%AT-COPY%% The values of the original-expressions  specified by \xcd`F` in 
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at (p;F)S` are copied to \xcd`p`, as follows.

The values mentioned in \xcd`S` are copied to place \xcd`p` by \xcd`at(p)S` as follows.

First, the original-expressions are evaluated to give a vector of X10 values.
Consider the graph of all values reachable from these values (except for 
\xcd`transient` fields 
(\Sref{sect:transient}, \xcd`GlobalRef`s (\Sref{GlobalRef}); also custom
serialization (\Sref{sect:ser+deser} may alter this behavior)). 

Second this graph is {\em
serialized} into a buffer and transmitted to place \xcd`q`.  Third,
the vector of X10 values is 
re-created at \xcd`q` 
by deserializing the buffer at
\xcd`q`. Fourth, \xcd`S` is executed at \xcd`q`, in an environment in
which each variable \xcd`v` declared in \xcd`F` 
refers to the corresponding deserialized value.  

Note that since values accessed across an \xcd`at` boundary are
copied, the programmer may wish to adopt the discipline that either
variables accessed across an \xcd`at` boundary  contain only structs 
or stateless objects, or the methods invoked on them do not access any
mutable state on the objects. Otherwise the programmer has to ensure
that side effects are made to the correct copy of the object. For this
the struct \xcd`x10.lang.GlobalRef[T]` is often useful.


\subsubsection{Serialization and deserialization.}
\label{sect:ser+deser}
\index{transient}
\index{field!transient}
The X10 runtime provides a default mechanism for
serializing/deserializing an object graph with a given set of roots.
This mechanism may be overridden by the programmer on a per class or
struct basis as described in the API documentation for
\xcd`x10.io.CustomSerialization`.  
The default mechanism performs a
deep copy of the object graph (that is, it copies the object or struct
and, recursively, the values contained in its fields), but does not
traverse or copy \xcd`transient` fields. \xcd`transient` fields are omitted from the
serialized data.   On deserialization, \xcd`transient` fields are initialized
with their default values (\Sref{DefaultValues}).    The types of
\xcd`transient` fields must therefore have default values.

The default serialization/deserialization mechanism will not (modulo
error conditions like \xcd`OutOfMemoryError`) throw any exceptions. However,
user code running during serialization/deserialization via
\xcd`CustomSerialization` may raise exceptions.  These exceptions are
handled like any other exception raised during the execution of an X10
activity.  However, due to the special treatment of \xcd`at (p) async S` 
(\Sref{AtStatement}) any exception raised during
deserialization will be handled as if it was raised by \xcd`async S`,
not by the \xcd`at` statement itself.


A struct \xcd`s` of type \xcd`x10.lang.GlobalRef[T]` \ref{GlobalRef}
is serialized as a unique global reference to its contained object
\xcd`o` (of type \xcd`T`).  Please see the documentation
of \xcd`x10.lang.GlobalRef[T]` for more details.



\subsection{{\tt at} and Activities}
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at(p;F)S` 
\xcd`at(p)S` 
does {\em not} start a new activity.  It should be thought of as
transporting the current activity to \xcd`p`, running \xcd`S` there, and then
transporting it back.  \xcd`async` is the only construct in the
language that starts a new activity. In different contexts, each one
of the following makes sense:
%%AT-COPY%% (1)~\xcd`async at(p;F) S` 
(1)~\xcd`async at(p) S` 
(spawn an activity locally to execute \xcd`S` at
\xcd`p`; here \xcd`p` is evaluated by the spawned activity) , 
%%AT-COPY%% (2)~\xcd`at(p;F) async S` 
(2)~\xcd`at(p) async S` 
(evaluate \xcd`p` and then at \xcd`p` spawn an
activity to execute \xcd`S`), and,
%%AT-COPY%% (3)~\xcd`async at(p;F) async S`. 
(3)~\xcd`async at(p) async S`. 
%%AT-COPY%% In most cases, \xcd`at(p;F) async S` is preferred to
%%\xcd`async at(p;F)`, since In most cases, \xcd`at(p) async S` is
preferred to \xcd`async at(p) S`, since the former form enables a more
efficient runtime implementation.  In the first case, the expression
\xcd`p` is evaluated synchronously by the current activity and then a
single remote async is spawned.  In the second case, \xcd`p` is
semantically required to be evaluated asynchronously with the parent
async as it is contained in the body of an async.  Therefore, if the
compiler cannot prove that "async at (p)" can be safely rewritten into
"at (p) async", a first local async is spawned to evaluate \xcd`p`
then a remote async is spawned to evaluate \xcd`S`.

Since 
%%AT-COPY%% \Xcd{at(p;F) S} 
\Xcd{at(p) S} 
does not start a new activity, 
\xcd`S` may contain constructs which only make sense
within a single activity.  
For example, 
\begin{xten}
    for(x in globalRefsToThings) 
      if (at(x.home) x().isNice()) 
        return x();
\end{xten}
returns the first nice thing in a collection.   If we had used 
\xcd`async at(x.home)`, this would not be allowed; 
you can't \xcd`return` from an
\xcd`async`. 

\limitation{
X10 does not currently allow {\tt break}, {\tt continue}, or {\tt return}
to exit from an {\tt at}.
}



\subsection{Copying from {\tt at} }
\index{at!copying}

%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at(p;F)S` copies data as specified by \xcd`F`, and sends it
\xcd`at(p)S` copies data required in \xcd`S`, and sends it
to place \xcd`p`, before executing \xcd`S` there. The only things that are not
copied are values only reachable through \xcd`GlobalRef`s and \xcd`transient`
fields, and data omitted by custom serialization.    
%%AT-COPY%% Several choices of copy specifier use the same identifier for the original
%%AT-COPY%% variable outside of 
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at(p)S` 
%%AT-COPY%% and its copy inside of \xcd`S`.  
%%AT-COPY%%

The \xcd`at` statement copies the \xcd`Cell` and its contents.  
After \xcd`(1)`, \xcd`c` is a \xcd`Cell` containing 9; call that cell {$c_1$}
At \xcd`(2)`, that cell is copied, resulting in another cell {$c_2$} whose
contents are also 9, as tested at \xcd`(3)`.
(Note that the copying behavior of \xcd`at` happens {\em even when the
destination place is the same as the starting place}--- even with
\xcd`at(here)`.)
At \xcd`(4)`, the contents of {$c_2$} are changed to 8, as confirmed at \xcd`(5)`; the contents of
{$c_1$} are of course untouched.    Finally, at \xcd`(c)`, outside the scope
of the \xcd`at` started at line \xcd`(2)`, \xcd`c` refers to its original
value {$c_1$} rather than the copy {$c_2$}.  
\end{ex}

The \xcd`at` statement induces a {\em deep copy}.  Not only does it copy the
values of variables, it copies values that they refer to through zero or more
levels of reference.  Structures are preserved as well: if two fields
\xcd`x.f` and \xcd`x.g` refer to the same object {$o_1$} in the original, then
\xcd`x.f` and \xcd`x.g` will both refer to the same object {$o_2$} in the
copy.  

\begin{ex}
In the following variation of the preceding example,
\xcd`a`'s original value {$a_1$} is a rail with two references to the same
\xcd`Cell[Long]` {$c_1$}.  The fact that {$a_1(0)$} and {$a_1(1)$} are both
identical to {$c_1$} is demonstrated in \xcd`(A)`-\xcd`(C)`, as {$a_1(0)$} is modified
and {$a_1(1)$} is observed to change.  In \xcd`(D)`-\xcd`(F)`, the copy
{$a_2$} is tested in the same way, showing that {$a_2(0)$} and {$a_2(1)$} both
refer to the same \xcd`Cell[Long]` {$c_2$}.  However, the test at \xcd`(G)`
shows that {$c_2$} is a different cell from {$c_1$}, because changes to
{$c_2$} did not propagate to {$c_1$}.

\subsection{Copying and Transient Fields}
\label{sect:transient}
\index{at!transient fields and}
\index{transient}
\index{field!transient}

Recall that fields of classes and structs marked \xcd`transient` are not copied by
\xcd`at`.  Instead, they are set to the default values for their types. Types
that do not have default values cannot be used in \xcd`transient` fields.

\begin{ex}
Every \xcd`Trans` object has an \xcd`a`-field equal
to 1.  However, despite the initializer on the \xcd`b` field, it is not the
case that every \xcd`Trans` has \xcd`b==2`.  Since \xcd`b` is \xcd`transient`,
when the \xcd`Trans` value \xcd`this` is copied at \xcd`at(here){...}` in
\xcd`example()`, its \xcd`b` field is not copied, and the default value for an
\xcd`Long`, 0, is used instead.  
Note that we could not make a transient field \xcd`c : Long{c != 0}`, since the
type has no default value, and copying would in fact set it to zero.

\subsection{Copying and GlobalRef}
\label{GlobalRef}
\index{at!GlobalRef}
\index{at!blocking copying}

%%The other barrier to the potentially copious copying behavior of \xcd`at`
%%is the \xcd`GlobalRef` struct.  
A \xcd`GlobalRef[T]` (say \xcd`g`) contains a reference to
a value \xcd`v` of type \xcd`T`, in a form which can be transmitted, and a \xcd`Place`
\xcd`g.home` indicating where the value lives. When a 
\xcd`GlobalRef` is serialized an opaque, globally unique handle to
\xcd`v` is created.  

\begin{ex}The following example does not copy the value \xcd`huge`.  However, \xcd`huge`
would have been copied if it had been put into a \xcd`Cell`, or simply used
directly.

Values protected in \xcd`GlobalRef`s can be retrieved by the application
%~~exp~~`~~`~~ g:GlobalRef[Any]{here == g.home}~~ ^^^Places4e7q
operation \xcd`g()`.  \xcd`g()` is guarded; it can 
only be called when \xcd`g.home == here`.  If you  want to do anything other
than pass a global reference around or compare two of them for equality, you
need to placeshift back to the home place of the reference, often with
\xcd`at(g.home)`.

There is an implicit coercion from \xcd`GlobalRef[T]` to \xcd`Place`, so
\xcd`at(argref)S` goes to \xcd`argref.home`.  


\subsection{Warnings about \xcd`at`}
There are two dangers involved with \xcd`at`: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Careless use of \xcd`at` can result in copying and transmission
of very large data structures.  
%%AT-COPY%% This is particularly an issue with the blanket
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at` statement, \xcd`at(p)S`, where everything used in \xcd`S` is copied.  
In particular, it is very easy to capture
\xcd`this` -- a field reference will do it -- and accidentally copy everything
that \xcd`this` refers to, which can be very large.  A disciplined use of copy
specifiers to make explicit just what gets copied can ameliorate this issue.

\item As seen in the examples above, a local variable reference
  \xcd`x` may refer to different objects in different nested \xcd`at`
  scopes. The programmer must either ensure that a variable accessed
  across an \xcd`at` boundary has no mutable state or be prepared to
  reason about which copy gets modified.   A disciplined use of copy specifiers to give
  different names to variables can ameliorate this concern.
\end{itemize}

%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`at`-statement.  In the following example, we return two data: 
%%AT-COPY%% one as a \xcd`val` named \xcd`square`, and the other as an addition in to a
%%AT-COPY%% partially-computed polynomial named \xcd`poly`.

%%AT-COPY%% The abbreviated forms 
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`athome (*) S` and 
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`athome S` 
%%AT-COPY%% allow a block of assignments without specifying the variables being assigned
%%AT-COPY%% to, which is convenient for a small set of assignments. 
%%AT-COPY%% They 
%%AT-COPY%% are both equivalent to \xcd`athome(V;F)S`,
%%AT-COPY%% where: 
%%AT-COPY%% \begin{itemize}
%%AT-COPY%% \item \xcd`V` is the list of all variables appearing on the left-hand side of
%%AT-COPY%%       an assignment or update statement in \xcd`S`, excluding those which
%%AT-COPY%%       appear inside the body of an \xcd`at` or \xcd`athome` statement in \xcd`S`;
%%AT-COPY%% \item \xcd`F` is the same as for \xcd`at(p)S` (\Sref{sect:copy-spec})
%%AT-COPY%% \end{itemize}

%%AT-COPY%% Much as the blanket \xcd`at` construct \xcd`at(p)S` is convenient for
%%AT-COPY%% executing a small code body at another place, the blanket \xcd`athome`
%%AT-COPY%% construct \xcd`athome(*) S` 
%%AT-COPY%% (which may be written as simply \xcd`athome S`)
%%AT-COPY%% is convenient for returning a result or two.   The
%%AT-COPY%% preceding example could have been written using blanket statements.

%%AT-COPY%% 
%%AT-COPY%% {\bf Design:} It is not fundamentally essential to distinguish \xcd`at` from
%%AT-COPY%% \xcd`athome`.  \xcd`at(p;F)S` could allow writing to variables whose homes are
%%AT-COPY%% known at compile-time to be equal to \xcd`p`.  Indeed, in earlier versions of
%%AT-COPY%% X10, it did so.    This required an idiom in which programmers had to manage
%%AT-COPY%% the home locations of variables directly, and keep track of which home
%%AT-COPY%% location corresponded to which variable.  The \xcd`athome` construct makes
%%AT-COPY%% this idiom more convenient.

This report provides a description of the programming
language \Xten. \Xten{} is a class-based object-oriented
programming language designed for high-performance, high-productivity
computing on high-end computers supporting $\approx 10^5$ hardware threads
and $\approx 10^{15}$ operations per second. 

\Xten{} is based on state-of-the-art object-oriented programming
languages and deviates from them only as necessary to support its
design goals. The language is intended to have a simple and clear
semantics and be readily accessible to mainstream OO programmers. It
is intended to support a wide variety of concurrent programming
idioms.
%, incuding data parallelism, task parallelism, pipelining.
%producer/consumer and divide and conquer.

%We expect to revise this document in the light of experience gained in implementing
%and using this language.

This document specifies the language corresponding to Version
\integerversion{} of the implementation. The redesign and reimplementation of arrays and rails was  done by Dave Grove and Olivier Tardieu.
 Version 1.7 of the report was co-authored by Nathaniel Nystrom. The design of structs in \Xten{} was led by Olivier Tardieu and Nathaniel Nystrom.

Earlier implementations benefited from significant contributions by
Raj Barik,

Tong Wen has written many application programs
in \Xten{}. Guojing Cong has helped in the
development of many applications.
The implementation of generics in \Xten{} was influenced by the
implementation of PolyJ~\cite{polyj} by Andrew Myers and Michael Clarkson.
